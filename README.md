## Block Quake
A total conversion mod for Quake featuring familiar plasic blocks.

---

Planned Block Quake versions include:
- `Vanilla` A blocky-themed replacement for the regular asssets in Quake, should work with most mods.

- `CustomC` A blocky-themed replacement and overhaul of Quake's source code to allow more special effects and minor gameplay changes.

- `ProgsDump`  Same changes as CustomC, with the added compatibility for use with ProgsDump mods and Trenchbroom level editing tools.

- `Friendly`  A stand-alone version of the blocky-theme that aims to reduce Quake's **Mature** rating into an **Everyone 10+** for younger audiences to enjoy.[^1]

Engine compatibility (confirmed support for):
- QuakeSpasm 0.93.2
- QuakeSpasm-Spiked
- DarkPlaces
- Remaster's KEX engine.

[^1]: Requires custom source code and will not be compatible with the other three Block Quake versions. Censorship of mature themes in Quake can only be applied to content that has been made specfically for this version. This includes core gameplay, enemies, weapons, maps, textures and sounds. If you add different model replacements from other mods, play online, or play on regular Quake maps, there is no way to obscure content that may not be suitible for younger audiences. This version is intended for parents who wish to play Quake together with their kids. It's also a great learning oppertunity for getting into level design with Trenchbroom. Remember to be responsible and always use adult supervision!
