## Block Quake
A total conversion mod for Quake featuring familiar plastic blocks.

### Block-Quake features the **Vanilla Folder version 1.1** and includes support for Copper using the new **Copper Folder version 1.1**

This GitHub version will be where the "No Paks / Folder" versions of Block-Quake will be from now on.  The installation method is intended for experienced Quake modders who want more control over their file management.  I'm assuming you already know how to install this and how to use it, if not, I highly recommend the simplier Itch-io pak version, here: https://kebby-quake.itch.io/block-quake

---

### Typical Folder installation:

Always create copies and backups of your game files before merging and double check the names.

1. Create a new game directory and name it "blockquake_vanilla"
2. Copy the contents of your "id1" Quake folder and paste them into the "blockquake_vanilla" folder
3. Download blockquake_vanilla1.1 and extract the contents of the Zip into the "blockquake_vanilla" folder
4. If prompted, merge the blockquake_vanilla folder contents
5. To play regular Block-Quake Vanilla, launch your source port with `-game blockquake_vanilla`

6. For Block-Quake Copper, install a copper-supported mod like Underdark Overbright, here: http://lunaran.com/copper/download/
7. Create a new game directory and name it "blockquake_copper"
8. Copy the contents of your "copper" mod folder and paste them into the "blockquake_copper" folder
9. Download blockquake_copper1.0 and extract the contents of the Zip into the "blockquake_copper" folder
10. If prompted, merge the blockquake_copper folder contents
11. To play the combined Block-Quake Copper, launch your source port with `-game blockquake_copper`

### Mods and Maps:

- The Block-Quake mod can only convert the original "id1" or "copper" file contents.  If you play another mod that uses "id1" as it's base, like a map-jam, everything should work just fine.

- If you are playing a large overhaul mod that adds new enemies and weapons like Arcane Dimensions or Alkaline, expect to see a lot of unblocky looking enemies and weapons.  Big mod projects like those won't be supported with blocky content for a very long time, sorry!

- A blocky themed enemy test room is included with the blockquake_vanilla.pak.  To play it, open the console and type: 
"map blocky_devroom_vanilla_v4" then press enter.
I'm hoping to add lots more maps after the Blocky texture pack is complete!
