## Block Quake
A total conversion mod for Quake featuring familiar plastic blocks.

---

### Block-Quake features the **Vanilla Folder version 1.1** and includes support for Copper using the new **Copper Folder version 1.0**

This GitHub version will be where the "No Paks" versions of Block-Quake will be.  This installation method is intended for experienced Quake modders who want more control over their file management.  I'm assuming you already know how to install this and how to use it, if not, I highly recommend the simplier Itch-io pak version, here:  https://kebby-quake.itch.io/block-quake

### Mods and Maps:

- The Block-Quake mod can only convert the original "id1" or "copper" file contents.  If you play another mod that uses "id1" as it's base, like a map-jam, everything should work just fine.

- If you are playing a large overhaul mod that adds new enemies and weapons like Arcane Dimensions or Alkaline, expect to see a lot of unblocky looking enemies and weapons.  Big mod projects like those won't be supported with blocky content for a very long time, sorry!

- A blocky themed enemy test room is included with the blockquake_vanilla.pak.  To play it, open the console and type: 
"map blocky_devroom_vanilla_v4" then press enter.
I'm hoping to add lots more maps after the Blocky texture pack is complete!

I have lots of features planned that I'd like to include, but these will take a long time to create and implement, thank you for being so patient, see you in the future!  -Kebby_⚙️
