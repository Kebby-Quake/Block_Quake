## Block Quake
A total conversion mod for Quake featuring familiar plasic blocks.

---

Planned Block Quake versions include:
- `Vanilla` A blocky-themed replacement for the regular asssets in Quake, should work with most mods.

- `CustomC` A blocky-themed replacement and overhaul of Quake's source code to allow more special effects and minor gameplay changes.

- `ProgsDump`  Same changes as CustomC, with the added compatibility for use with ProgsDump mods and Trenchbroom level editing tools.

- `Friendly`  A stand-alone version of the blocky-theme that aims to reduce Quake's **Mature** rating into an **Everyone 10+** for younger audiences to enjoy.[^1]

---

Completed and ready for playtesting:
- Blocky themed characters, enemies and boss models, textures and animations.
- Blocky themed weapon pickups, weapon model textures and animations.
- Blocky themed ammo, armor, items and powerup models.
- Blocky themed test map (blocky_devroom_vanilla_v4) including the blocky_WAD_v4 (with five colors).

---

Planned future features:
- Add some Blocky themed sound effects for weapons, enemies and objects.
- Finish all blocky themed models like enemy projectiles and the BSP ammo boxes for the Vanilla version.
- Finish the new gibbed-limbs and blocky blood models for the CustomC source code overhaul version.
- Once CustomC is complete, implement the new source code changes into the ProgsDump version.
- Censor the entire game and remove any mature themed content and replace it with age appropriate material.
- Finish the Blocky WAD textures by adding more brick pattern variety and color options.
- Create some Blocky themed maps in Trenchbroom and maybe have a Block Quake Map Jam! *(eventually)*

Confirmed engine compatibility:
- QuakeSpasm 0.93.2
- QuakeSpasm-Spiked
- DarkPlaces
- Remaster's KEX engine.

[^1]: Requires custom source code and will not be compatible with the other three Block Quake versions. Censorship of mature themes in Quake can only be applied to content that has been made specfically for this version. This includes core gameplay, enemies, weapons, maps, textures and sounds. If you add different model replacements from other mods, play online, or play on regular Quake maps, there is no way to obscure content that may not be suitible for younger audiences. This version is intended for parents who wish to play Quake together with their kids. It's also a great learning oppertunity for getting into level design with Trenchbroom. Remember to be responsible and always use adult supervision!
